### General Concepts we'll cover:
* Schema
* Subscription
* Mutations
* Queries


## Demos


## Backend

[https://hasura.io/](https://hasura.io/)
Just to get us moving quickly. Sets up a GraphQL endpoint on a Postgres database.

We're going to use Heroku...
Follow the instructions here (set up a Heroku account if you don't already have one):
[https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/getting-started/heroku-simple.html](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/getting-started/heroku-simple.html)

Post deployment:
Example:
[https://gql-postgres.herokuapp.com/console](https://gql-postgres.herokuapp.com/console)


### ExpressJS

#### Basics

```

var  express  =  require('express');
var  app  =  express();
//adding the apolloServer
const { ApolloServer, gql } =  require('apollo-server-express');

//schema
const  typeDefs  =  gql`
type Query {
books:[Book]
book: Book
}

type Book {
title: String!
author: String!
published: Int!
}
`;

// resolvers - this is the function that says how to get the data!
const  resolvers  = {
Query: {
books: () =>  books,
book: () => {
return {
title:  'A System Of Logic',
author:  'John Stewart Mill',
published:  1876
}
}
}
}
// this is the Apollo server - passing the typeDefs (i.e. Schema, and resolvers)
const  server  =  new  ApolloServer({
typeDefs,
resolvers
});

//use the middleware to attach
server.applyMiddleware( {app} );
```
  
## General concepts

### Schema

Types (scalar):

-   ID
-   Int
-   Float
-   String
-   Boolean
    
Types can also be Objects... (Examples):

-   People
-   Car
-   Book
    
These types can have modifiers:

#### Example:

-   String = nullable string
    
-   String! = non-nullable
    
-   [String] = List of nullables
    
-   [String]! = non-nullable list of nullable strings ðŸ˜Š
    
-   [String!]! = non-nullable list of non-nullable strings
    

Lets Build a Schema (typeDef in Apollo Server language):

This is a __Query__...

```
/* remember - resolvers are the functions to 
   tell you how to get your data
*/
const  resolvers  = {}
gql`
	Query: {
		books: () =>  books
	}
	This is the Type...

	Type User {
	Id: ID
	Name: String!
	Email: String!
	}
`
```
